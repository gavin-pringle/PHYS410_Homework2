\subsection*{Introduction}

In this homework assignment, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for computing numerical solutions of 
ODEs is explored. This is done in stages, culminating in creating a MATLAB function that numerically
integrates an ODE using an algorithm that automatically varies the step size of the integrator in order
to achieve a relative error tolerance. 

First, a function \code{rk4step} is written that computes a single fourth-order Runge-Kutta step for a 
system of coupled first-order ODEs, returning the approximate values of the dependent variables after
a defined time step. The function \code{rk4step} is then used in the function \code{rk4} which computes 
the solution of an initial value problem over a range of values for the independent variable, done by 
taking multiple fourth-order Runge-Kutta steps in a loop. Lastly, the function \code{rk4ad} is written 
which finds the numerical solution of an initial value problem by comparing the results of fourth-order 
Runge-Kutta steps of different sizes and then varying the step size as until the error in the 
approximation is below a specified relative tolerance.

\subsubsection*{Casting systems of ODEs in first-order form}

In order to solve complicated ODEs numerically, it is useful to first cast them in a canonical form that 
is easier for a computer program to understand. Any ODE defining the function $y(x)$ that is of the form 
$$f(x, y, y', y'', y^{(3)}, \ldots,  y^{(N)}) = 0$$
can be rewritten as a system of $N$ coupled first-order ODEs for the functions 
$y_i(x), \quad i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, N$:
\begin{equation}\label{sys_DE}
y_i'(x) \equiv \frac{dy_i}{dx}(x) = f_i(x, y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots, y_N)
\end{equation}
where $f_i$ are known functions of $x$ and $y_i$. This is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{sys_DE_vec}
\mathbf{y'} = \mathbf{f}(x, \mathbf{y}) \quad \textrm{where} \quad \mathbf{y} \equiv (y_1, y_2, y_3, 
\ldots, y_N)
\end{equation}

For example, the function $y^{(4)}(x) = f(x)$ can be written as 
$$y_3' = f, \quad y' = y_1, \quad y_1' = y2, \quad y_2' = y_3$$

\subsubsection*{The fourth-order Runge-Kutta step}

The fourth-order Runge-Kutta step for numerically solving a system of $N$ coupled first-order ODEs is 
defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{rk_step}
y_i(x_0 + h) = y_i(x_0) + \frac{h}{6} (f_{0,i} + 2f_{1,i} + 2f_{2,i} + f_{3,i})
\end{equation}
with the terms $f_{0,i} \;f_{1,i} \;f_{2,i} \;f_{3,i}$ given by 
\begin{align*}\label{rk_step_f_defs}
f_{0,i} &= f_i(x_0, \;y_{0,i}) \\
f_{1,i} &= f_i\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, \;y_{0,i} + \frac{h}{2} f_{0,i}\right) \\
f_{2,i} &= f_i\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, \;y_{0,i} + \frac{h}{2} f_{1,i}\right) \\
f_{3,i} &= f_i\left(x_0 + h, \;y_{0,i} + h f_{2,i}\right) \\
\end{align*}
where each $f_i$ on the right-hand sides  of the above equations are defined in (\ref{sys_DE}) and 
h is the step size. This can be understood as a weighted sum of four numerical approximations to the 
solution of the ODE. A single fourth-order Runge-Kutta step is accurate to $O(\Delta t^5)$.
