\subsection*{Introduction}

In this homework assignment, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for computing numerical solutions of 
ODEs is explored. This is done in stages, culminating in creating a MATLAB function that numerically
integrates an ODE using an algorithm that automatically varies the step size of the integrator in order
to achieve a relative error tolerance. 

First, a function \code{rk4step} is written that computes a single fourth-order Runge-Kutta step for a 
system of coupled first-order ODEs, returning the approximate values of the dependent variables after
a defined time step. The function \code{rk4step} is then used in the function \code{rk4} which computes 
the solution of an initial value problem over a range of values for the independent variable, done by 
taking multiple fourth-order Runge-Kutta steps in a loop. Lastly, the function \code{rk4ad} is written 
which finds the numerical solution of an initial value problem by comparing the results of fourth-order 
Runge-Kutta steps of different sizes and then varying the step size as until the error in the 
approximation is below a specified relative tolerance.

\subsubsection*{Casting systems of ODEs in first-order form}

In order to solve complicated ODEs numerically, it is useful to first cast them in a canonical form that 
is easier for a computer program to understand. Any ODE defining the function $y(t)$ that is of the form 
$$f(t, y, y', y'', y^{(3)}, \ldots,  y^{(N)}) = 0$$
can be rewritten as a system of $N$ coupled first-order ODEs for the functions 
$y_i(t), \quad i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, N$:
\begin{equation}\label{sys_DE}
y_i'(t) \equiv \frac{dy_i}{dt}(t) = f_i(t, y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots, y_N)
\end{equation}
where $f_i$ are known functions of $t$ and $y_i$. This is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{sys_DE_vec}
\mathbf{y'} = \mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{y}) \quad \textrm{where} \quad \mathbf{y} \equiv (y_1, y_2, y_3, 
\ldots, y_N)
\end{equation}

For example, the function $y^{(4)}(t) = f(t)$ can be written as 
$$y_3' = f, \quad y' = y_1, \quad y_1' = y2, \quad y_2' = y_3$$

\subsubsection*{The fourth-order Runge-Kutta step}

The fourth-order Runge-Kutta step for numerically solving a system of $N$ coupled first-order ODEs is 
defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{rk_step}
y_i(t_0 + h) = y_i(t_0) + \frac{h}{6} (f_{0,i} + 2f_{1,i} + 2f_{2,i} + f_{3,i})
\end{equation}
with the terms $f_{0,i} \;f_{1,i} \;f_{2,i} \;f_{3,i}$ given by 
\begin{align}\label{rk_step_f_defs}
f_{0,i} &= f_i(t_0, \;y_{0,i}) \\
f_{1,i} &= f_i\left(t_0 + \frac{h}{2}, \;y_{0,i} + \frac{h}{2} f_{0,i}\right) \\
f_{2,i} &= f_i\left(t_0 + \frac{h}{2}, \;y_{0,i} + \frac{h}{2} f_{1,i}\right) \\
f_{3,i} &= f_i\left(t_0 + h, \;y_{0,i} + h f_{2,i}\right)
\end{align}
where each $f_i$ on the right-hand sides of the above equations are defined in (\ref{sys_DE}) and 
h is the step size. This can be understood as a weighted sum of four numerical approximations to the 
solution of the ODE. A single fourth-order Runge-Kutta step is accurate to $O(\Delta t^5)$.

\subsection*{Numerical Approach}

\subsubsection*{Consecutive fourth-order Runge-Kutta steps}

In order to compute the numerical solution to an ODE (or in canonical form, a system of first-order 
ODEs), multiple consecutive fourth-order Runge-Kutta steps must be taken. The MATLAB implementation of 
a single fourth-order Runge-Kutta step is shown in Appendix A as \code{rk4step.m}, while Appendix C 
shows the MATLAB implementation of a complete fourth-order Runge-Kutta ODE integrator as \code{rk4.m}. 
In \code{rk4.m}, equation (\ref{rk_step}) is repeatedly computed using the previous output of equation 
(\ref{rk_step}) as an input. The step size \code{dt} is given by the difference at the current time-step 
between independent variable values at which the solution of the ODE is to be computed at, passed as 
\code{tspan}.

It is important to note that while a single fourth-order Runge-Kutta step is accurate to $O(\Delta t^5)$,
the full numerical solution to and ODE given by \code{rk4.m} is accurate to $O(\Delta t^4)$, since
error accumulates linearly throughout the integration. 

\subsubsection*{Adaptive step sizing}

The Runge-Kutta integrator can be made more accurate by varying the step size \code{dt} at each step 
depending on an estimation of the error accumulated in that step. To show how the per-step error can be
estimated using time-steps of multiple lengths, consider (for each dependent variable y in the system of 
ODEs) a "coarse" step of length $\Delta t$ (producing the output $y_C$) and two "fine" steps of length 
$\Delta t / 2$ (producing the output $y_F$).
\begin{align*}\label{y_F_and_y_C}
y_C(t_0 + \Delta t) &\approx y_{\text{exact}}(t_0 + \Delta t) + k(t_0) \Delta t^5 \\
y_F(t_0 + \Delta t) &\approx y_{\text{exact}}(t_0 + \Delta t) + k(t_0) \left( \frac{\Delta t}{2} 
\right)^5 + k\left(t_0 + \frac{\Delta t}{2}\right) \left( \frac{\Delta t}{2} \right)^5 \\
&\approx y_{\text{exact}}(t_0 + \Delta t) + 2 k(t_0) \left( \frac{\Delta t}{2} \right)^5
\end{align*}
In the above equations, $k(t)$ is some function of time. Subtracting $y_F$ and $y_C$ at the advanced time,
we get
\begin{equation}\label{error_estimation}
y_C(t_0 + \Delta t) - y_F(t_0 + \Delta t) \approx \frac{15}{16}k(t_0) \Delta t^5 \approx \frac{15}{16}e_C
\end{equation}
which yields an estimate for the local solution error $e_C$.

This error estimation is implemented in the MATLAB function \code{rk4ad.m} (Appendix F), which functions 
as an adaptive step size fourth-order Runge-Kutta ODE integrator. In \code{rk4ad.m}, similar to 
\code{rk4.m}, the function is written to compute the values of the ODE defined by the argument \code{fcn}
at the times defined in \code{tspan}, with the initial values of the dependent variables defined by 
\code{y0}. However, the additional argument \code{reltol} is also passed which directs the function to 
iteratively decrease the step sizes in between values of \code{tspan} until the step-size to step-size 
error described above is below \code{reltol}. A lower bound for the step-size is defined by the constant 
\code{floor = 1.0e-4}.

At each time-step in \code{rk4ad.m}, the coarse numerical solution is computed using the distance to the 
next time-step and the fine numerical solution is computed using two time-steps equalling half the 
distance to the next time step. These solutions are then compared as shown in (\ref{error_estimation}). If 
the estimated solution error is above \code{reltol}, the process is repeated where each fine step is 
divided into two even finer steps and the solution across the four time steps is compared to the solution
across the two time steps. If the new estimated error is below \code{reltol}, the process stops and the 
function moves on to computing the solution at the next time-step, and if not the process of successively 
halving the step-size continues until either \code{reltol} is achieved or the step-size limit \code{floor}
is reached.

\subsection*{Implementation}

\subsubsection*{ODE test functions} % sho and vdp

In order to test the functions \code{rk4step.m}, \code{rk4.m}, and \code{rk4ad.m}, sample ODEs must be
used. The first of the two ODEs used in this assignment to test the ODE integrators is the ODE for the
simple harmonic oscillator with unit angular frequency. This ODE is given by the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{sho_ode}
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}(t) = -x(t)
\end{equation}
with the initial conditions 
$$x(0) = 0, \quad \frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 1$$
In the canonical first-order form this ODE can be written as 
$$\frac{dx_1}{dt} = x_2, \quad \frac{dx_2}{dt} = -x_1$$
where 
$$x_1 = x, \quad x_2 = \frac{dx}{dt}$$
The function \code{fcn\_sho} was written to implement this ODE in MATLAB in order to pass it to 
\code{rk4.m} and \code{rk4ad.m}:
\begin{verbatim}
function dxdt = fcn_sho(t, x)
    dxdt = zeros(2,1);
    dxdt(1) = x(2);
    dxdt(2) = -x(1); 
end
\end{verbatim}

The second of the two ODEs used is the ODE for the unforced Van der Pol oscillator, shown below
\begin{equation}\label{vdp_ode}
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}(t) = -x(t) - a(x(t)^2 - 1)\frac{dx}{dt}(t)
\end{equation}
In this assignment, $a = 5$ and the following initial conditions are used: 
$$x(0) = 1, \quad \frac{dx}{dt}(0) = -6$$
In the canonical first-order form this ODE can be written as 
$$\frac{dx_1}{dt} = x_2, \quad \frac{dx_2}{dt} = -x_1(t) - a(x_1(t)^2 - 1)x_2(t)$$
where 
$$x_1 = x, \quad x_2 = \frac{dx}{dt}$$
The function \code{vdp\_sho} was written to implement this ODE in MATLAB in order to pass it to 
\code{rk4.m} and \code{rk4ad.m}:
\begin{verbatim}
function dxdt = fcn_vdp(t, x)
    global a;
    dxdt = ones(2,1);
    dxdt(1) = x(2);
    dxdt(2) = -x(1) - a*(x(1)^2 - 1)*x(2);
end
\end{verbatim}
